# Reinforcement Learning: Cliff Walking
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Mahmood-Anaam/reinforcement-learning-cliff-walking/blob/main/reinforcement-learning-cliff-walking.ipynb)
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of two fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms, **Q-learning** and **SARSA**, applied to the **Cliff Walking** environment. The project explores how these algorithms learn to navigate the gridworld, avoid the cliff, and reach the goal while minimizing penalties.

## Key Concepts
- **Parts:**
  - **Q-learning:** An off-policy algorithm that learns the optimal policy by estimating the maximum future rewards.
  - **SARSA:** An on-policy algorithm that updates its policy based on the actual actions taken, leading to potentially safer but less aggressive strategies.
  - **Comparison:** A detailed comparison of the paths chosen by each algorithm, highlighting differences in exploration and exploitation behaviors.

- **Tasks:**
  - Implement and evaluate the Q-learning algorithm.
  - Implement and evaluate the SARSA algorithm.
  - Compare and analyze the optimal policies derived from both algorithms.
